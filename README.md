# Parking Reservation

Web app for reserving office parking spots, backed by [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com/?referral=enzy). Built with [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) and [QwikCity](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/overview/).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `^18.17.0 || ^20.3.0 || >=21.0.0`
- A Google Cloud project with OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Optionally a GitHub OAuth app, to offer GitHub sign-in as well
- SpacetimeDB table

## Environment Variables

Copy the example file and fill in your credentials:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable                    | Description                                           | Required |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`          | Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID                            | Yes      |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`      | Google OAuth 2.0 Client Secret                        | Yes      |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`          | GitHub OAuth app Client ID                            | No       |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`      | GitHub OAuth app Client Secret                        | No       |
| `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`        | Callback URL for both providers, localhost by default | No       |
| `PUBLIC_SPACETIMEDB_MODULE` | Database name                                         | Yes      |
| `PUBLIC_SPACETIMEDB_URI`    | Database cluster                                      | Yes      |
| `API_KEYS`                  | Comma-separated API keys for REST API access          | No       |

## Sign-in

Users sign in with Google or with GitHub; both providers land on the same
`/api/auth/callback` route and the provider is chosen with `/api/auth?provider=github`.
Leave the `GITHUB_*` variables unset and the GitHub button simply will not work.

Sign-in is **not an access control** — the parking data is public by design. It exists
to deter bots and to prefill the reservation name, so any Google or GitHub account is
accepted. Reservations are keyed by the display name the provider returns (`name`,
falling back to the `@login` for GitHub accounts with no name set), so signing in
through a different provider than usual can produce a different name.

## Importing the legacy spreadsheet

Before SpacetimeDB the reservations lived in a Google Spreadsheet with one tab
per year. `scripts/migrate-from-sheet.mjs` imports a year of that spreadsheet
into the database, treating the spreadsheet as the source of truth — it
**overwrites** the spots and every reservation on the dates the sheet covers.

```shell
node scripts/migrate-from-sheet.mjs --year 2026           # dry run: report only
node scripts/migrate-from-sheet.mjs --year 2026 --apply   # write to the database
node scripts/migrate-from-sheet.mjs --help                # all flags
```

Requires the [`spacetime` CLI](https://spacetimedb.com/install), logged in
(`spacetime login`). Run the dry run first — it prints the spot list, date range
and reservation count it parsed, plus any rows it could not make sense of.

What it does **not** touch: reservations on dates outside the sheet (pass
`--wipe` to clear those too), and spots the sheet no longer lists (pass
`--remove-missing-spots` to delete those and all of their reservations).

The reducers the script calls are restricted to the identities listed in
`ADMIN_IDENTITIES` in `spacetimedb/src/index.ts` — reducers are callable by any
client that can reach the module, so a "delete every reservation" reducer cannot
be left open. If a call is rejected, the error names the calling identity; add it
there and re-publish. These reducers exist only for this import and can be
deleted once it is done.

## Development

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:5173` with SSR and hot module replacement.

## Production Build

```shell
npm run build
```

This generates `dist/` (client assets) and `server/` (Fastify server bundle). To run it locally:

```shell
ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 npm run serve
```

The `ORIGIN` environment variable is required for CSRF protection and must match the URL users access the app from.

## Docker

### Build and run with Docker

```shell
docker build -t nice-parking .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env -e ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com nice-parking
```

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```shell
# Start in the background
docker compose up -d

# With a custom origin
ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop
docker compose down
```

The compose file reads credentials from your `.env` file and defaults `ORIGIN` to `http://localhost:3000` if not set.

## REST API

A REST API (`/api/v1`) is available for AI agent and programmatic access. Authentication is via Bearer token — set the `API_KEYS` environment variable with one or more comma-separated keys.

- **OpenAPI spec**: [`/openapi.json`](public/openapi.json) — machine-readable specification for tool generation

### Production Checklist

- Set `ORIGIN` to your actual domain (e.g. `https://parking.example.com`) -- required for CSRF protection
- Set `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` to your production callback URL (`https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback`) — it defaults to the localhost one, so a deployment that leaves it unset will bounce users to `localhost:5173`
- Register that same URL in your Google Cloud Console and as the Authorization callback URL of your GitHub OAuth app
- Ensure outbound HTTPS access to `accounts.google.com`, `googleapis.com`, `github.com` and `api.github.com`
