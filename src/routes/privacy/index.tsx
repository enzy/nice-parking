          <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
          <p>
            The user data we access from Google or GitHub is used strictly for
            the following purposes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Authentication and identification:</strong> Your display
              name is used to identify you within the application, so other
              users can see who has reserved a parking spot. Your name is
              displayed in the application header and used as the label when you
              reserve a parking spot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Parking spot management:</strong> Your display name is
              stored alongside your reservations in the database to identify who
              has reserved each spot.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not use this data for advertising, marketing, profiling,
            analytics, or any purpose unrelated to the core functionality of
            managing parking spot reservations. Your data is not used for
            training machine learning or artificial intelligence models.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell, trade, rent, or transfer your Google or GitHub user
            data to any third parties. Specifically:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              No personal data is shared with advertisers, data brokers, or
              marketing services.
            </li>
            <li>
              No analytics or tracking services (such as Google Analytics) are
              used.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your name, as stored in parking reservations, is visible to other
              authorized users of the Service. This is necessary for the core
              functionality — allowing team members to see which parking spots
              are reserved and by whom.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Data Storage and Protection</h2>
          <p>
            We take the following measures to securely store and protect your
            data:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Database:</strong> Parking reservation data (your display
              name associated with a parking spot and date) is stored in a
              SpacetimeDB Cloud database. The connection between your browser
              and the database uses encrypted WebSocket connections (WSS).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cookie-based session storage:</strong> Your authentication
              data is stored in browser cookies on your device:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Display name:</strong> Stored in a browser cookie for
                  identification purposes. Expires after 30 days.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sign-in state:</strong> A random value stored as an
                  HTTP-only cookie while you are being redirected to Google or
                  GitHub, used to protect the sign-in against cross-site request
                  forgery. Expires after 10 minutes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HTTPS encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between
              your browser and the Service is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Session data:</strong> Authentication cookies are
            automatically deleted by your browser when they expire (display name
            after 30 days, sign-in state after 10 minutes). You can delete all
            session data at any time by logging out of the Service, which
            immediately clears all authentication cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reservation data:</strong> Your display name in the database
            is retained for as long as you have an active parking spot
            reservation. When you release a spot, your name is immediately
            removed from that reservation entry. Historical reservation data may
            remain in the database for past dates.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Requesting data deletion:</strong> You may request the
            deletion of your personal data at any time by contacting the
            application administrator. Upon receiving your request, we will
            remove your name from any active or historical reservation entries
            and confirm completion within a reasonable timeframe.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also revoke the application's access to your Google account
            at any time by visiting your{" "}
